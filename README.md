The README file for cURL
A README file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called Read Me, READ.ME,[1] README.TXT,[2][1] README.md[1] (for a text file using markdown markup), README.1ST[1]  – or simply README.[1]

The file's name is generally written in uppercase letters. On Unix-like systems in particular this makes it easily noticed – both because lowercase filenames are more usual, and because traditionally the ls command sorts and displays files in ASCII-code order, so that uppercase filenames appear first.[nb 1]

Contents
The contents typically include one or more of the following:

Configuration instructions
Installation instructions
Operating instructions
A file manifest (list of files included)
Copyright and licensing information
Contact information for the distributor or programmer
Known bugs[3]
Troubleshooting[3]
Credits and acknowledgments
A changelog (usually for programmers)
A news section (usually for users)
History

It is unclear when the convention began, but there are examples dating back to the mid 1970s.[4][5][6][7][8][9][1][better source needed] Early Macintosh system software installed a Read Me on the startup disk, and they commonly accompanied third-party software.

In particular, there is a long history of free software and open-source software including a README file; in fact it is a requirement in the GNU Coding Standards.[10][better source needed]

Since the advent of the web as a de facto standard platform for software distribution, many software packages have moved (or occasionally, copied) some of the above ancillary files and pieces of information to a website or wiki, sometimes including the README itself, or sometimes leaving behind only a brief README file without all of the information required by a new user of the software.

In more recent times, the popular GitHub proprietary Git repository[11] strongly encourages a README file - if one is included in the main (top-level) directory, it is automatically presented on the main web page. While traditional plain text is supported, various different file extensions and formats are also supported,[12] and conversion to HTML takes account of the file extension of the file – in particular a "README.md" file would be treated as a GitHub Flavored Markdown file.

As a generic term
The expression "readme file" is also sometimes used generically, for files with a similar purpose.[citation needed] For example, the source code distributions of many free software packages, especially those following the Gnits Standards or those produced with GNU Autotools, include a standard set of readme files:

README	General information
AUTHORS	Credits
THANKS	Acknowledgments
CHANGELOG	A detailed changelog, intended for programmers
NEWS	A basic changelog, intended for users
INSTALL	Installation instructions
COPYING / LICENSE	Copyright and licensing information
BUGS	Known bugs and instructions on reporting new ones
CONTRIBUTING / HACKING	Guide for prospective contributors to the project
Other files commonly distributed with software include a FAQ and a TODO file listing possible future changes.

 This is often no longer the case – but LC_ALL=C ls will show the older behavior.

[README.TXT is the DOC file for SPICE/SINC/SLIC] This failsafe tape contains the circuit analysis programs SPICE SINC and SLIC described in the Applications Software Bulletin Volume 4. requirements: SPICE requires FORTRAN-10 version 4 because of its use of Right adjusted Holerith data. Executes in about 47K. […] it also includes this file, the FOROTS to go with the SAVes and the source for SECOND.MAC, the timing routine. SPICE is broken into three parts: 1SPICE.FOR, 2 and 3. There is a printed document to describe each of the programs. These are included in the DECUS packet. The documentation and programs were origionally developed by the E.E. department of the Univ. of Calif. at Berkeley on a CDC 6400. Except to convert the FORTRAN to the DECsystem-10 no changes have been made to the programs. For the test data SLIC and SINC have shown a slight variation with respect to the 6400, SPICE shows no variation. Good luck! Ashley Grayson 27-NOV-74 [end of README.TXT]

[…] they had READMEs (actual physical printed files) for all of their punch cards and mag tape and pretty much anything else that was a "program". At that time you really needed one because of the labourous process that was involved with getting the created, ran, and everything else. These READMEs sometimes also included the actual printouts of how the punch cards were supposed to be punched as a form of error checking and debugging. The convention apparently also follows the old system in that with all the punch cards a "reem" of paper was attached with the statement README in caps printed on it, this had all of the instructions for use and loading of the punch cards into the system. For a time reference, this would have been in the 60s. […]
